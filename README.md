# Beta_profile
Subthalamic beta profile of Parkinson's patients with sensing-enabled DBS devices and directional DBS leads.

This repository can be used as a tool to plot Power Spectra, extract peak values in beta frequency bands and re-organize multiple LFP channels by ranking their peak power values recorded from chronically implanted DBS leads of patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The overarching aim of this repository is to support clinicians during DBS programming by providing beta power information from multiple recording sites.

- LFP data should be recorded from an implanted Medtronic Percept PC device and SenSight leads (directional leads) using the BrainSense Survey modality (15 LFP channels, 20 sec recording duration)
- The GitHub repository PyPerceive must be installed: https://github.com/jgvhabets/PyPerceive
- The onedrive folder from our Teams Channel (Percept_Data_structured) must be accessible locally on your computer
